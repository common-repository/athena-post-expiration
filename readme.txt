Schedule posts, pages, and custom post type to expire at a certain time.

== Description ==
Schedule posts, pages, and custom post types to expire using various expire options. The expiration options include draft, delete, private, password protect, and category assignment.  If you have numerous posts that require the same expiration date that may change in the future assign an expiration profile. You are able to change the expiration date for numerous posts in one simple location.

Email notification is available to expiration profiles to remind you of the exact profile, date and time that it's set to expire. Profiles work great if you have posts or pages surrounding a sale that you need to expire at a certain date.

When you use profiles in any post type they take precedence over assigning an individual date or action on that post. Make sure that you deselect any profile in order to assign an individual date and action.

*Note: Upon uninstalling this plugin all instances of its data are completely removed.
